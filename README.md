# subreddit-search
Python program that searches through up to 10 subreddits for keyword(s). The program uses PRAW to access the Reddit API and a GUI through PyQt4. It compiles the results into a single screen and also provides a link to the thread. This is a work in progress. 

Future additions could include:
- more user flexibility on what parts of the subreddit they search.
- more efficient and useful searching of multiple keywords.
- general UI improvements
